# Spreadsheet Data Analysis & Dashboard Creation Project

## Project Summary

This project utilized various spreadsheet tools (primarily **Microsoft Excel** or **Google Sheets**) to perform end-to-end data analysis on two distinct sales datasets: **Furniture Sales** and **Bike Sales**. The core objective was to transform raw transactional data into insightful metrics and compelling visualizations, culminating in interactive dashboards designed for business stakeholders.

## Datasets and Tools

The analysis involved integrating and processing several component files for both projects:

| Project | Key Data Files | Core Analytical Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Furniture Sales** | `Furniture_Sales.csv`, `Furniture_data.csv`, `Calculations.csv` | Calculating sales growth, profit margins, and time-based KPIs using formulas. |
| **Bike Sales** | `bike_buyers.csv`, `working sheet.csv`, `pivot table.csv`, `dashboard.csv` | Analyzing customer demographics, creating customer segments, and generating aggregated reports. |
| **Primary Tool** | **Spreadsheet Software (e.g., Excel)** | Used for all data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. |

## Key Analytical & Technical Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases a grasp of practical, foundational spreadsheet analytics techniques:

### 1. Data Preparation and Transformation
* **Data Cleaning:** Addressed inconsistencies, formatted data types (e.g., dates, currency), and ensured data quality for accurate analysis (evident in the "working sheet" file).
* **Formula Application:** Used **Index/Match** to merge customer information with transactional data and applied **Conditional Logic** (`IF`/`IFS` statements) to derive new categorical fields (e.g., Age Brackets).

### 2. Aggregation and Summarization
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Calculated core sales metrics, including **Total Revenue**, **Total Units Sold**, **Average Order Value (AOV)**, and **Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales Growth** (`Calculations.csv`).
* **Pivot Tables:** Created robust **Pivot Tables** (`pivot table.csv`) to efficiently aggregate and summarize data across multiple dimensions (e.g., sales by product category, customer count by age/gender).

### 3. Visualization and Reporting
* **Dashboard Design:** Designed the **`dashboard.csv`** sheet to present the key findings and KPIs in a clear, single-view layout.
* **Visual Storytelling:** Created various chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to effectively visualize sales trends, regional performance, and customer segment preferences.
* **Interactivity:** Incorporated dynamic features like Slicers and Filters to enable end-users to interact with the dashboard data.
